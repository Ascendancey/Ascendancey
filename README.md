- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ascendancey
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development, specifically in React.js.
- 🌱 I’m currently working with React.js and Spring Boot (Java) and testing out different frameworks (NestJS) and API languages (GraphQL).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the projects in the field that I will find meaningful.
- 📫 You can always reach me with an email in my profile (to the left).
